# Suunnitelma

1.
The website is meant for the people that are interested in F1 and want to know more about the F1 seasons and the current F1 Drivers, Races and Championship. I hope a lot of F1 fans are going to use this website to find info on their favorite F1 drivers.

2.
The website is meant to be used during the weeks after F1 races or any time when you are interested in wanting to know whats going on with F1 currently of the info that you can find on my website. Website can be used whenever you want because it isn't really restrictive on when you want to search info about F1 online.

3.
For UI you can see the proto of what the frontpage looks like by running React and checking it but I am aiming it to be pretty regular UI where the different directories are on the top and the text is on the middle of the page with the possible picures that might be included later. I am going to later also try to make it that UI of opening the F1 Driver bios could have a picture of the F1 driver in question and make it that info about the driver is on the picture right side and under the picture. With the charts where the championship I am doing spreadsheet where you can easily see which part of the info is in Question for example: Name, Team and Nationality on the chart of the drivers and then when you would press the drivers name you would get the Driver BIO opened

4.
During the implementation of the Website I will be using React and SQL. React for the base of the website for all of the directories within the website. I am using SQL for all the charts in the Website like charts about the drivers that are then fetched when you click on the drivers name on the drivers page where you can see more about the drivers. I am aiming to have similar features for the rest of the other charts on races and the Championship.

5.
I am doing project alone so I am in sole-control of project Github Repository. I will be doing the website myself so not sure how much and large website I can do but I hope to have all of the directories filled that I currently have in the working Prototype.
I am doing the testing myself after almost every change I do. I usually test my website almost everytime I make a slight modification to the file for example adding a picture but I will be using in the website I will check that it works before I might commit it to Git Repository
